# lists

These are my solutions for the Try It Yourself exercises in chapter 3 of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by Eric Matthes.

We explore lists, and how to work with individual items in a lsit. We define lists, and use various methods to add and remove elements from the lists. We also learn how to sort the lists, and how to find the length of a list.
